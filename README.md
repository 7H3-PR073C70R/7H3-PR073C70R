Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Samuel Mayowa
I currently work as Flutter developer with lots of industrial experience in creating scalable and maintainable projects. I have previously worked as a Web developer/UIUX designer for international and local-based organizations. I pay a lot of attention to details in making sure my apps follow major UX rules and design patterns. All my recent projects follow the clean architecture and the MVVM approach. I also write articles and work on demo projects to contribute to the flutter community.
